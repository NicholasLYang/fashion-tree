# Fashion Tree

Fashion Tree is the application for the environmentally concerned shopper. Fashion Tree analyzes the material composition of the clothing, along
with the sourcing and price, then, using a custom algorithm, it determines the environmental impact of the clothing. Furthermore, it compiles 
the overall impact of a given brand and displays it.
